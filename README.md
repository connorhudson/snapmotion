snapmotion v1.0
========

A block module and local server for Snap! to interface with the Mindstorms NXT.

#Requirements
* A Leap Motion device
* Python 2.6+
* The Leap Motion Python library

#Getting Started
* Make sure that the Leap.py file and all the Leap library files (.so) are in the same directory as these files.
* Load Snap! in your browser window.
* Import the snapmotion.xml file.
* Connect your Leap to your computer.
* In a command line, navigate to the directory where you are storing these files.
* As a root user, type `python snapmotion.py`.
* The program should print something like `Now serving on port 3434.`
* **Enjoy!**
